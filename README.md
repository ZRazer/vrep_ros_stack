vrep_ros_stack
==============

Personal development for the VREP ros stack

This code is mostly based on the original ROS plugin stack available in the V-REP package (http://www.v-rep.eu/). 

Most code has been authored by M. Frese from Coppelia Robotics.

Adaptation to more data types and publishers by C. Pradalier.
